# pixel-avatar

> pixel-avatar is a very simple javascript (snippet? program? script?) to generate github-like avatars with the HTML canvas.

I made this mainly to demonstrate how bad my Javascript programming is.

## Contributing

Please, feel free to open an issue to suggest a cool feature or to tell me how bad my code is.

Since I see this as an exercise, I would love to implement new functions to test my skills.

## Features

* Generates 5x5 pixel avatars
* Random colors

## Todo

* Make avatar color selectable
* Different avatar dimensions
* Generate multiple avatars at the same time
* Better organization of the code
* Implement tests with Jasmine
* Write tests for Jasmine
* Wonder why I need test for this
* Lose hope
* Rinse and repeat
